This is the repository of my capstone project on the evolution of air quality in urban congestion charging cities.  
The python code "#finalised project" renders a dashboard of the project's results.  
**The six Excel files contain the data for the project and are to be downloaded.**  
**This python code requires that the user inserts the Excel files manually by using his/her own access path.**  
**Should be done as follows:**

**The user's göteborgPM10.xlsx access path** should be copied and placed **in code's line 19** instead of "C:\Users\James Curtin\OneDrive\Documents\advanced programming\göteborgPM10.xlsx" (the developper's own access path).

User's access path to be copied for **göteborgNO2.xlsx** and to be placed in **line 20**.

User's access path to be copied for **NO2_tables_2021secondshot.xlsx** and to be placed in **line 87**.

User's access path to be copied for **PM10_tables_2021.xlsx** and to be placed in **line 88**.

User's access path to be copied for **Aria_2004-2021.xlsx** and to be placed in **line 146**.

User's access path to be copied for **2001_2022_NO2__STATISTICHE.xlsx** and to be placed in **line 192**.

User's access path to be copied for **2002_2022_PM10__STATISTICHE.xlsx** and to be placed in **line 193**.

Then, by simply **running the code** we get access to a **link to the dashboard app**.
